<h1 align="center">rcp</h1>
<h3 align="center">A VERY unsafe version of scp or rsync</h3>

I literally just build this to send stuff between my PC's in my local network, so please don't use this to 
send high secure data between devices!

### How to use rcp

The syntax is pretty similar to scp and rsync:

```rcp <filename> <filename on remote device>@<remote address with/without port>```

If no port is given the standard port (3000) will be used.
